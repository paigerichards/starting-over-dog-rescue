    <p tabindex="0"> Every Year in Australia over 250 000 healthy and rehomeable dogs and cats are killed in Australian Pounds. We are a Registered Victorian Animal Welfare Charity operating as a Community Foster Care Network making a difference to those statistics. We offer wonderful family companions for adoption that we have saved from being killed in Victorian pounds.<br> Welcome to the dedicated volunteer community of Starting Over Dog Rescue.</p>

    <h2 tabindex="0"> OSCARS LAW</h2>
    <p tabindex="0"> Oscar’s Law is a not-for-profit volunteer organisation, dedicated to deminishing puppy factories in Australia. Our mission at Starting Over Dog Rescue is: to cease the factory farming of animals in Australia, to ban the sale of animals from pet shops and online trading sites, and promote adoption through rescue groups, pounds and shelters.</p><p tabindex="0">Puppy factories are intensive breeding facilities for animals, which put profit ahead of the welfare of the animal. Puppy factory dogs are frequently seen without adequate food, water and shelter, and their veterinary care and social needs are completely ignored. Breeding dogs are permanently confined their entire lives and forced to breed back to back litters. Most suffer painful, untreated health conditions. </p><p tabindex="0">Puppy factory dogs are never patted, never walked, never shown any love. They’re never allowed to love and nurture their puppies, which are taken from them at a few weeks old. When their exhausted bodies are no longer able to breed these poor animals are killed and replaced.</p><p tabindex="0">These cruel facilities supply pet shops with puppies, where they are sold to the public as being from “reputable breeders”. They’re also traditionally sold through online ads.  Puppy factory puppies often have serious illnesses or defects from bad breeding practices, with many of them becoming sick and dying before being sold.</p><p tabindex="0">Oscar’s Law encourages all Australians to take a stand and protest that we do not want animals factory farmed anymore and we do not want the pet industry to mislead us about what is acceptable for our animals.</p><p tabindex="0"> Visit our About and <a href="#" id="faq">FAQ</a> pages to learn more about the nature of animal factory farming.</p>
